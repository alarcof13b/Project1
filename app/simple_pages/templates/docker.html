        <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
            your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage
            your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s
            methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay
            between writing code and running it in production. Docker provides the ability to package and run an
            application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to
            run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed
            to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can
            easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container
            that works in the same way.</p>

                        class="text-muted">Understanding the differences.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Docker containers and virtual machines are both ways of deploying applications inside
                    environments that are isolated from the underlying hardware. The chief difference is the level of
                    isolation. With a container runtime like Docker, your application is sandboxed inside of the
                    isolation features that a container provides, but still shares the same kernel as other containers
                    on the same host. As a result, processes running inside containers are visible from the host system
                    (given enough privileges for listing all processes). Having multiple containers share the same
                    kernel allows the end user to bin-pack
                    lots and lots of containers on the same machine with near-instant start time. Also, as a consequence
                    of containers not needing to embed a full OS, they are very lightweight, commonly around 5-100
                    MB.</p>
                <p class="lead">In contrast, with a virtual machine, everything running inside the VM is independent of
                    the host operating system, or hypervisor. The virtual machine platform starts a process (called
                    virtual machine monitor, or VMM) in order to manage the virtualization process for a specific VM,
                    and the host system allocates some of its hardware resources to the VM. However, what’s
                    fundamentally different with a virtual machine is that at start time, it boots a new, dedicated
                    kernel for this VM environment, and starts a (often rather large) set of operating system processes.
                    This makes the size of the VM much larger than a typical container that only contains the
                    application.</p>

                <p class="lead">The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects
                    such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons
                    to manage Docker services. A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry
                    that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can
                    even run your own private registry. When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, the
                    required images are pulled from your
                    configured registry. When you use the docker push command, your image is pushed to your configured
                    registry. When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes,
                    plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects. </p>
                <p class="lead">An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
                    Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may
                    build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your
                    application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. You might
                    create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a
                    registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the
                    steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the
                    image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed
                    are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to
                    other virtualization technologies.</p>

                <p class="lead">Git Tags are specific reference points in the Git history. Git tags are used to capture
                    the specific point in the history that is further used to point to a released version. A tag does
                    not change like a branch. They don’t have a further history of commits after being created. Most
                    people use this feature to mark some release points like (v1.0,…v4.0, and so on). In simple words,
                    Git Tags are used to give some meaningful name to a particular in the git project repository.
                    Suppose two users decide to tag their project code for access later.</p>
