        <p>Git is version control technology that helps track, review, and approve changes in collaboration with other
            people. Git's branching model means that we can diverge from the main line of development and continue to
            work without messing with that main line, hence using a development version that would later be integrated
            to the master or production version of the project. When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that
            contains a pointer to the
            snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email address, the
            message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its
            parent or parents).</p>

                <p class="lead">The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making
                    branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally
                    just as fast. Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a
                    day. Git doesn’t store data as a series of change sets or differences, but
                    instead as a series of snapshots. Using branches allows the developer to segregate and
                    compartmentalize different parts of an application. For example, different programmer can work on
                    different functions or features of the app, simultaneously in different locations, this allows for
                    better collaboration, while also ensuring the quality of the final product. Branching also allows to
                    work on the project piece by piece, while testing it and validating the usefulness of the new
                    code. To adda a branch type "git branch [branch-name], to switch to another branch type "git
                    checkout [branch]".</p>

                    the specific point in the history that is further used to point to a released version. A tag does
                    not change like a branch. They don’t have a further history of commits after being created. Most
                    people use this feature to mark some release points like (v1.0,…v4.0, and so on). In simple words,
                    Git Tags are used to give some meaningful name to a particular in the git project repository.
                    Suppose two users decide to tag their project code for access later.</p>
